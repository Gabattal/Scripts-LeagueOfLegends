## The concept

By using the live client I'm able to detect when I kill or die in game.

Depending on if I die or if I kill someone, the script will write a sentence for me. Here is an exemple when I die :

## How do you use it ?

* You just need to install **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** on your computer, and you execute the launch.bat.
Feel free to modify the sentences in the txt files.

## Be careful

The script has been approved by riot's developers, however depending on what you wrote in the txt file, you may get a little surprise like this:
