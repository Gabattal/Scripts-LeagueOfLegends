# Auto-Champ-Select : Draft / Ranked

# The concept

By using the live client Data and the League Client Update:
* Accept your match
* Ban the champion you want
* Pick the champion you want
* Alert you when your game started

# How do you use it ?

## Step 1 :
* You need to install **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** on your computer
## Step 2 :
* You modify the txt files to fill the data you want (picks, bans and the music that will be launched once the game start) <br>
PS : Order in the files is important, for example in this case :<br>

If Yone and Jax are banned, it will pick Aatrox.
Also make sure you write the name of the champion you want to play exactly like in game, for example you have to write "LeBlanc" and not "leblanc".
* You execute the launch.bat 
## Step 3 :
* You pick your roles, and you start searching for a game.
* You take a nap, you call your grandmother to check up on her, you kill these f*cking mosquitoes around you
* You play :)


# Concerning the runes
Depending on the pick you may need different runes, in my case I am using the [Porofessor App](https://porofessor.gg/) 
which automatically import the right runes for your champion.

# Problems you can encounter
* Make sure that you have the autoplay activated on YouTube / your browser otherwise the music won't start.
