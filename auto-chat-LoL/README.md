# Auto-chat (League of Legends)

## The concept

By using the live client I'm able to detect when I kill or die in game.

Depending on if I die or if I kill someone, the script will write a sentence for me. Here is an exemple when I die :

## How do you use it ?

You just need python installed on your computer, and you execute the launch.bat.
Feel free to modify the sentences in the txt files.

## Be careful

Not because it is a script but depending of what you wrote in the txt file, you may get a little surprise like this:
